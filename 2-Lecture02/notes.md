# Naming Rules of C Identifiers

-   Keywords can't be used as identifiers as they are predefined.
-   Out of the character set that C uses, only the alphabets (upper and lowercase) and the underscore symbol (\_) are allowed in the identifier. It implies that you can't use characters like the punctuation symbols etc. as a part of the identifier.
-   The identifier must start either with an alphabet (upper or lowercase) or an underscore. It means, a digit cannot be the first character of the identifier.
-   The subsequent characters may be alphabets or digits or an underscore.
-   Same identifier can't be used as a name of two entities. An identifier can be used only once in the current scope.
